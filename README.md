# Lift Simulation Project

A web-based lift simulation application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project visualizes lift operations across multiple floors and allows users to interact with the system by calling lifts to specific floors.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization:** Visual representation of up to 20 floors and 5 lifts.
- **Lift Dispatch:** Users can call lifts to specific floors with real-time updates.
- **Adjustable Timing:** Simulates lift movements with dynamic transition timing based on height differences.

## Challenges Overcome

- Resolved alignment issues to ensure lifts are correctly positioned after movements.
- Implemented dynamic transition timing for accurate simulation.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
